Greetings!

As a current employee of Apple, I'm continuously learning new things and keeping up with new technology. I have a passion for problem solving and finding the most efficient way to do something. GitHub has changed the game with efficiency and collaboration. In a previous life, I worked a lot of music projects and often working on them with many different people. Making changes separately and trying to bring them together was pretty much impossible. The concept of GitHub's tools to collaborate would have been such a time saver and allow for creativity independently to come together. I want to work for GitHub because I want to be a part of something great.

Being at Apple and in the tech support industry, I’ve met a lot of amazing people. A previous coworker of mine, Nick Cannariato, showed me GitHub and I was amazed at not only the abilities of the software, but the company’s vibe and sense of community that really drew me. Now that Nick started at GitHub, he has nothing be good things to say about you guys and I know its something I want to be a part of. Outside of work, I also share a strong passion for health and fitness, and being the best version of myself I can be. I want to take that passion to help make GitHub the best company it can be, and bring my positive energy into a team of amazing people to do great things.

I know my experience at Apple has giving me the skill set to bring great customer service and communicate effectively. As the most tenured technician on my team, I’m seen as a leader and am frequently training new hires to make our team great. I would love to be a part of GitHub’s team and ensure GitHub continues to push the envelope in excellent customer service.

Thank you very much for your consideration and I look forward to discussing this with you!

Sincerely,

Victoria Munsell
